<b> Just with one quick look at this map, it's easy to see that Austin is surrounded on all sides by beautiful green spaces. As Longhorns and city dwellers, it can be easy to box yourself in both mentally and physically, and convince yourself that you're trappd in a concrete jungle. The benefits of time spent outside -- especially in beautiful green spaces -- are huge, and well-documented. Click anywhere to begin and start exploring some of the green spaces you can WALK TO from the UT campus!</b>
